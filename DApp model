----Functioning----

Server - helps clients connected to it to find each other

Client - connects to server to find other users
       - connects to miner for verifying the digital signature
       - connects to other client to send or receive the leetcoin

Miner  - user connects to it to verify the digital signature

----Public key sharing model----

Server - generates RSA private and public key & shares the public key to client when they connect to the server

Client - generates RSA private and public key
       
       - shares the public key to server when it connects to the server,
       - after server and client has shared the public key to each other, the client generates an AES key and 
         uses the server's public key to encrypt the AES key and sends it to server. this symmetric key will 
         be used to communicate between the server and client
       
       - shares the public key to miner with transaction hash and signature for verifying the signature 
       - after miner and client has shared the public key to each other, the client generates an AES key and 
         uses the miner's public key to encrypt the AES key and sends it to miner. this symmetric key will 
         be used to communicate between the miner and client

       - shares the public key to client when it connects
       - after sender client and receiver client has shared the public key to each other, the receiver client 
         generates an AES key and uses the sender client's public key to encrypt the AES key and sends it to 
         sender client. this symmetric key will be used to communicate between the sender client and receiver client

Miner  - generates RSA private and public key & an AES key
       
       - share the public key to client it's going to verify
       - after miner and client share the public key to each other, miner encrypts the symmetric key using 
         client's public key and sends it to the client. this symmetric key will be used for encrypting the
         transaction hash, signature and public key which client will send to miner for digital signature's verfication.


----detailed verification process----
For a transaction to be verified on a blockchain, several other pieces of information are needed in addition to the transaction itself. Some of the key components that are needed for a transaction to be verified include:

*) The sender's public key: This is used to verify that the sender has the necessary funds and permission to initiate the transaction.

*) The recipient's public key: This is used to determine where the funds should be transferred.

*) A signature: This is generated using the sender's private key and is used to verify that the transaction was initiated by the owner of the public key.

*) A fee: Most blockchain networks require a small fee to be paid in order to process the transaction.

*) A block header: This contains information such as a unique identifier for the block, a reference to the previous block in the chain, and a timestamp.

*) A hash: This is a unique digital fingerprint of the transaction and the block header, and is used to secure the integrity of the data in the blockchain.
